              The history of Bose Corporation began with disappointment. In
              1956, MIT graduate student Amar Bose bought one of the best stereo
              systems at the time for his home. After a few minutes of listening
              to the audio recording, his bewilderment turned to disappointment.

              From Amar's point of view, the sound was so flat and unnatural
              that it was better not to listen to the music at all than to
              listen to it in such a distorted form.
